The topic of this week is programming in C.

https://cs50.dev - All code will be written throughout this course in this browser-based version of VScode.

Source code - This is the code that programmers write in human readable format
Machine code - This is a binary file of 0s and 1s that the computer understands.

How do we convert source code to machine code?
- You use a compiler (for languages like C, Rust, Java)
- And an interpreter (for languages like Python, and Javascript)

The three terminal commands needed to make, compile and run C files in the VScode container:

code <filename>.c - Create a C source file with the desired name
make <filename> - This will compile the source file (with the same name?) into a binary file
./hello - This command to execute binaries in the terminal

For CS50 libraries and other documentation:

A library of functions written by other programmers can be accessed using the header file.
In C, these are the files that end with the '.h' extension.

CS50 has its own library called cs50.h
This header file contains the following functions:

get_char - prompts user for a line of text from stdin and returns...
get_double - prompts user for a line of text from stdin and returns...
get_float - prompts user for a line of text from stdin and returns...
get_int - prompts user for a line of text from stdin and returns...
get_long - prompts user for a line of text from stdin and returns...
get_long_long - prompts user for a line of text from stdin and returns...
get_string - prompts user for a line of text from stdin and returns...

'string' is a datatype in the cs50 library.
They have probably typedef-ed char name[] to string, but for the first few lectures, might need to declare strings in this way.
Rather than char name[n];

Another unnecessary change -> rather than using %d to format integers into formatted prints, you use %i.
However, %d works just fine!

// The C convention of the keep the main() function as close to the top of the file as possible.
// Therefore, you declare the function before main(), and define it afterwards.
// This declaration is known as the prototype.
// This is acceptable by the gcc compiler.

Typecasting - Official term for converting one data type to another in a programming language.
int x = 5;
int y = 2;
float z = (float) x / y;
If we don't typecast either x or y to a float, then 5/2 will return 2, not 2.5.
This is known as truncation.
When a math operation results in a floating point number, if the number is assigned to an integer datatype, then everything after the 
decimal point will be truncated.

Floating point imprecision is the other issue that can arise when trying to store floating point numbers.
Floats are only accurate till a certain number of decimal points, regardless of if you use float or double data type.
This is because only a finite amount of memory can be used to store each floating number.

In computers, the flow of time is tracked in seconds from January 1st, 1970.

Luhn's algorithm - Topic for one of the problem set questions
This algorithm is a checksum for a valid credit or debit card number
The algorithm works like this:
- Multiple every other digit, starting from the 10s position, by 2.
- Add all the DIGITS of the results of the individual multiplications.
- So, if the multiplication resulted in 12, you would add 1 + 2.
- Add all the remaining numbers that weren't multiplied by 2.
- Add the two results and that resulting number should be a multiple of 10 to be a valid credit or debit card.
